Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

The two primary operations in a stack are:
- Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Remove the element from the top of the stack.

Function Call Management:
- Stacks are used to manage function calls and recursive calls in programming languages.

Depth-First Search (DFS):
- In graph traversal, stacks are used to manage the nodes that need to be explored.

Time and Space Complexity
Push/Pop Operations: Both are O(1) since elements are added or removed from the top.
Space Complexity: Typically O(n) where n is the number of elements, but specific problems may optimize this based on the approach (e.g., using a single stack vs. multiple stacks).
