A tree whose elements have at most 2 children

When doing recursion, the space complexity is the height of the tree

Balanced Binary tree
- Height of tree is O(logn) where n is number of nodes
- Height of left and right subtree does not differ by more than 1
- Left and Right subtrees are also balanced

Level Order 
- left, right
- O(n) and O(w) width of tree
- BFS search order

Pre-Order
- current, left, right
- O(n) and O(h)
- DFS search order
- used for prefix expression trees and for tree serialization/deserialization

Inorder
- left, current, right
- O(n) and O(h)
- used for BST for ascending order
