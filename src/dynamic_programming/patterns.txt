Overlapping Subproblems:

A problem has overlapping subproblems if the same subproblems are solved multiple times.
For example, in the Fibonacci sequence, fib(n) is computed from fib(n-1) and fib(n-2), which are computed multiple times in a naive recursive approach.


Memoization (Top-Down Approach):
Store the results of subproblems in a table (or dictionary) to avoid redundant calculations.
Typically implemented using recursion with a cache.

Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach):
Solve subproblems in a specific order and store their results in a table to build up the solution to the problem.
Typically implemented using iterative loops.

Optimize space usage by reducing the size of the DP table when possible.
